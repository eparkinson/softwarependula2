# About me
Hi! My name is Elroy Parkinson. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa and this is my blog.

I am a Solutions Architect with 20 year's experience as an IT professional. I have a very analytical mind and love finding elegant, simple, cost-effective technical solutions to tough business problems. I am particularly interested in Cloud Architecture, containerization using Kubernetes, Agile software development and Spring Boot micro-services.


I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science from the University of Port Elizabeth (now the [Melson Mandela Metropolitan University](https://www.mandela.ac.za/)) and an MBA from [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au/) in Australia.

# About my blog

## Topics

This blog started out way in 2013. You can read about how embarrassingly optimistic I was about it (as well as the corny reason for the title) in my first post [here](/post/software-pendula/).

Mostly I cover Software Development and Architecture topics that I've had to think about - either as part of my work or sometimes just out interest. I find writing down my thoughts helps me clarify and internalise them. Coming back to what I've written years later also serves to remind me how wrong I can be sometimes despite having been so confident at the time. It's a valuable life lesson. :smile:


## Technical details

As I said, this blog started out on Google's https://www.blogger.com following a (rare) New Year's resolution in 2013. That platform is still around but nowhere near as active as it used to be and so for 2021 I've decided to self-host on Google's Cloud platform using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) framework - mostly as a way to learn more about the tech. The details are probably a good topic for a future post.

## Side Hustle

[Chat-Leads.net](https://www.chat-leads.net/) - helping small business exploit AI technology to generate sales.

AI chatbots represent a game-changing tool for generating sales leads. These advanced, AI-powered chatbots are available 24/7, ensuring that your business never misses an opportunity to engage with potential clients. They can handle multiple inquiries simultaneously, providing instant, personalized responses that keep customers engaged. This efficiency not only improves customer satisfaction but also significantly reduces the workload on your sales team, allowing them to focus on closing deals rather than fielding initial queries.

## Published Papers

During my time as a post grad student, I managed to publish two papers that started my interest in using AI techniques to solve planning and scheduling problems. AI planning is a topic that seems to have taken a back seat in recent times to the deep learning craze. 

- Parkinson E & Warren PR (1995) [A comparison of graph colouring techniques.](https://www.softwarependula.net/papers/graph-colouring.pdf) South African Computer Journal, Number 14, 1995
