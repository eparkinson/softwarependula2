I have high hopes for this blog. It was a new year’s resolution to become a more active blogger than my previous attempt as can be seen at [elroyparkinson.blogspot.com](http://elroyparkinson.blogspot.com). I still plan to keep that going for non-software related blogs if the urge strikes me once a year or so as has been the case historically.

Software Pendula will however focus exclusively on software development and architecture and I plan to blog at least once every couple of months here. “Pendula”, by the way is the plural of “pendulum” and yes, it is less common than “pendulums”, but I like the sound of it more so I will use it.

Why “Software Pendula”? Because it occurred to me a long time ago that trends in Software development have a lot in common with [Hegel’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) theory of historical development and follow the same three laws:

1. Each historical phase follows a necessary course and that it could not have been arrived at through any other sequence of events.
1. Each subsequent phase is not just a change but also represents progress.
1. Each historical phase (thesis) tends to be replaced by the opposite (antithesis) followed by a phase of settling in the middle ground (synthesis) between the two extremes.

This is Hegel’s Pendulum theory.


The history of software development spans a far shorter period than the recorded history Hegel had to work with in the late 18th/early 19th century, but already there are many examples of “Software Pendula” to be seen:

1. Static vs. dynamic languages.
1. JavaScript vs. view components created in *pick your favourite language*.
1. Externalising configuration in XML vs. internalising it with annotations.
1. Many, many more...


So what will this blog be about? Well, not software pendula as such. I will review and discuss specific technologies, languages, frameworks and architectural patterns and styles that strike my fancy and in the process of trying to learn new stuff, I will record my experiences and conclusions here. And in the process, every so often I just might just notice a swing of the pendulum in progress and I’ll point at it and giggle just a little.
